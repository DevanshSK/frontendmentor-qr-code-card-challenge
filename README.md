## My process
First I structured the HTML according to the project.
Then I did the styling required as per the styling guide.
Then I used GSAP to add the animations to improve the feel of the website. 
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) - JS animation library

### What I learned

Here I learned about CSS flexbox and GSAP animations.

The code to GSAP animations is given below:

```js
  // Card animation
  gsap.fromTo(card, {scale: 0}, {scale: 1, duration: 1, ease: "elastic.out(1.5, 1)"});

  // Footer animation
  gsap.set('.letter', {display: "inline-block"});
    
  gsap.fromTo('.letter',{y:"100%", opacity: 0} ,{y:0, duration: 0.75, opacity: 1, delay: 2, stagger: 0.05, ease: "back.out(3)"});
```

### Continued development

In future, I want to recreate this card component using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) entirely, When I am more comfortable in React.
